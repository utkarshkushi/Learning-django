    <h2 class=pro-h2>Begginer</h2>
    <h3 class="pro-h3">1.Sending Emails with Python</h3>
        <p class="pro-p">Project idea – Automate the process of sending emails with some customized features based on business requirements. You can have a list of email addresses and their respective names. Then you can modify the message and send emails to the target audience automatically.</p>
        
     <h3 class="pro-h3">2. Login System in Django</h3>
        <p class="pro-p">Project idea – Implement a basic template of a login system and then you can use the template in any web app with just minimal changes to quickly build the web apps. Nowadays every website requires their customers to create accounts therefore this template will be very useful.</p>
        
        
    <h3 class="pro-h3">3. Django Chat App</h3>
        <p class="pro-p">Project idea – Create a simple chat app where you can create chat rooms and users will chat in real-time. You don’t need to store all the previous chat records as you can display only a few recent chats and older chats will be deleted.</p>   
        
    <hr class="pro-line">    
        
    <h2 class=pro-h2>Intermediate</h2>  
            <h3 class="pro-h3">1. Socket Programming in Python</h3>
        <p class="pro-p">Project idea – Socket programming is a way of establishing a connection network between the client and a server. We can send data in any direction easily which allows us to build apps. Socket programming is mostly used in chat apps.</p>   
        
         <h3 class="pro-h3">2. Todo App in Django</h3>
        <p class="pro-p">Project idea – The project involves the building of a todo application. In a todo app, a user can keep track of all the things he/she is planning to do and create a list. They can then update the list when the task is completed. Build a nice app with basic Html, CSS, and JavaScript and host on the localhost server using Django or Flask framework.</p>  
        
        
          <h3 class="pro-h3">3. Railway Enquiry System</h3>
        <p class="pro-p">Project idea – The Indian railway system has provided us with an API from railapi.com through which we can gather all the information about the status of the train, PNR number, etc in real-time. The idea of this project is to create a web app using the railapi that will give us all the information about the user queries related to the railway.</p>

         <h2 class=pro-h2>Advance</h2>  
            <h3 class="pro-h3">1. Clothes Online Store with Payment</h3>
        <p class="pro-p">Project idea – Another good project is to build a web application for an online store. Users can buy merchandise from the store so we also need to set up a payment module to handle transactions.</p>   
        
         <h3 class="pro-h3">2. Interactive Web Maps</h3>
        <p class="pro-p">Project idea – An interactive web map uses data and animations to provide an amazing experience to the users. It is challenging to build an interactive map as the graphics had to be changed according to the user interacting with the map.</p>  
        
        
          <h3 class="pro-h3">3. Django Social Network App</h3>
        <p class="pro-p">Project idea – The social network app is a platform for people to communicate with each other, make friends, and express their views through text, images, etc. We should also think about the security and privacy of the user’s data as they will use this app to have private conversations.</p>
